Explanation of Changes:

Inputs for Docker Credentials:
I've added two new inputs to the workflow_dispatch section: docker_username and docker_password. These will allow you to provide your Docker registry credentials when manually triggering the workflow.
Environment Variables for Docker Credentials:
I've added corresponding environment variables DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD in the env section of the deploy_and_load job. These variables retrieve the values from the workflow inputs.
Build and Push Docker Image Step:
I've added a new step named Build and Push Docker Image.
if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}: This condition ensures that this step only runs when code is pushed to the main branch. You can adjust this condition to match your branching strategy.
echo "$DOCKER_PASSWORD" | docker login -u "$DOCKER_USERNAME" --password-stdin: This command logs in to your Docker registry. Important: This is generally safe for GitHub Actions, but be aware that exposing passwords in logs should be avoided whenever possible. Consider using secrets if you have very strict security requirements and your registry supports that.
docker build -t your-username/your-image-name:${{ github.sha }} .: This command builds the Docker image.
your-username/your-image-name: Replace this with your actual Docker Hub username and image name.
${{ github.sha }}: This is a unique identifier for the Git commit, which is used as a tag for the image. This is a good practice for versioning.
.: This specifies the current directory as the build context (where the Dockerfile is located).
docker push your-username/your-image-name:${{ github.sha }}: This command pushes the image to your Docker registry using the Git SHA as the tag.
Optional: Tagging latest (Use with Caution):
docker tag ... :${{ github.sha }} your-username/your-image-name:latest: This creates an additional tag named latest.
docker push ... :latest: This pushes the image with the latest tag.
Caution: Using the latest tag can be problematic in production environments because it's mutable (it changes with each push). It can lead to unpredictable deployments. It's generally recommended to use immutable tags (like Git SHAs or version numbers) for production.
Before You Use This:

Replace Placeholders: Make sure to replace your-username/your-image-name with your actual Docker Hub username and the desired name for your image.
Dockerfile: Ensure your Dockerfile is correctly set up to build your application.
Registry Credentials:
If you're using Docker Hub, provide your Docker Hub username and password.
If you're using another registry (e.g., GitHub Container Registry), you'll need to adjust the docker login command and potentially the image naming.
Security: Be mindful of securely handling your Docker registry credentials. GitHub Actions secrets are the recommended way to manage sensitive information.
Branching Strategy: Adjust the if condition to match your branching strategy.
This enhanced workflow will now build, tag, and push a Docker image to your registry whenever code is pushed to the main branch. Remember to adapt it to your specific needs and security best practices.
